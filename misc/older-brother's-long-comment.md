Hey, alt.

First thing first, remember this is actually your main. This new experience **is the real you**. Your brain will struggle with that for a while. Imposter syndrome is common, dysphoria (or euphoria) may come and go, and only you can decide what being trans actually means to you. Transitions (and degree of transition) are personal and are not an indicator of transness. 

You may also feel a great deal of conflict about the dissonance between your body and the body you desire. Be compassionate in choosing that target. Whatever you look like, there's someone of the opposite gender with basically the same body and face, out there killin' it. Find that person and emulate them, rather than pounding your face against things out of your control. If you choose to make physical changes, that's okay, too.

For many people, it gets harder before it gets easier. Some people in your life may think this is something you are choosing, rather than something that is core to you. You may have to make major life changes to find safe spaces in which to rebuild your persona. This is not weakness or a character flaw; setting yourself up for success is a strength. 

You may have to mourn some relationships, but you aren't doing this *to* anyone. You are accepting a truth about yourself, and taking steps to protect your physical and emotional health. If, in the course of your exploration, you find a barrier you can't climb over, you may have to go around it. You may have to change your environment. But even if you find yourself temporarily isolated, you are not alone.
