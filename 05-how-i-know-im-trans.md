So how does one go about concluding that they're trans?
For most of my early life I assumed the following things:

+ I'm cis

+ I'm straight

for no real reason other than those being the 'default'. 
That's wrong. 
Make no assumptions about your identity.

[Cis is considered the default by society. Why?](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/)

There's no reason. 
The only reason I thought I was cis was because I had been told so.
After all, being trans was for ***other people***, right?

So, let me candidly submit the following:

+ Before identifying as NB, I *despised* gender. Not the gender binary, gender itself. This was before I had even heard of being nonbinary, and started about half a year before identification. In hindsight, holy heck was that a sign. It turns out, I don't hate gender, I just hate the binary.

+ I grew my hair out. I managed to convince myself that this was because I hated haircuts, but there was always this little repressed hope that one day I would have long hair.

+ I hated shopping for my assigned gender's clothes. I now love shopping for clothing from both sections of the store.

+ I hated my face. Some of my facial features just got under my skin, for reasons I couldn't quite place.
