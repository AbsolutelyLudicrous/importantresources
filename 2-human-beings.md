We're people just like you.
No, seriously, read the last paragraph of my introduction;
do I sound trans?
We're quite human.

Meaning: Stop saying 'trans(gender) people', start saying 'people'. 
Unless being trans is important to the information you're trying to convey, don't mention it.

More things you shouldn't say:

+ '$name, who used to be $deadname, ...'; Just don't, their dead name is dead, you'll just encourage attacks.

+ 'Back when $pronoun was $deadpronoun, ...'; Again, you'll encourage hate. Either tell past stories with current pronouns or use gender neutral pronouns.

+ 'trap', 'tranny', 'Attack Helicopter', etc.; You do not have N-Word Privelages for those words and your Attack Helicopter(tm) jokes aren't funny. If you say those things, I *will* slap you.

What should you say, then?:

+ '$name'; that's their name. Not $deadname, their name is $name.

+ Proper pronouns; do not misgender a person. If, when, you mess up, correct yourself immediately.

+ 'they'; If you're ever unsure about gender, use gender neutral pronouns.

This also means you should treat trans people as human;
do not, unless asked to\*, use 'it' to refer to a trans person.
We are people.

Again, I need to hammer that home: transgender **people**

\*^(Some NB people *do* use 'it' for their pronouns, in this case you should *absolutely* refer to it with 'it'.)
