We're people just like you.
No, seriously, read the last paragraph of my introduction;
do I sound trans?
We're quite human.

Meaning: Stop saying 'trans(gender) people', start saying 'people'. 
Unless being trans is important to the information you're trying to convey, don't mention it.

This also means you should treat trans people as human;
do not, unless asked to\*, use 'it' to refer to a trans person.
We are people.

Again, I need to hammer that home: transgender **people**

\* (Some NB people *do* use 'it' for their pronouns, in this case you should *absolutely* refer to it with 'it'.)
