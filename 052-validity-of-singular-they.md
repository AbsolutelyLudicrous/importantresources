No, 'they' is not *always* plural.

Singular 'they' is just as valid as 'he' or 'she'.

Shakespeare even used singular 'they' in many of their works.
Over 2500 times, in fact.

So why would you use 'they' instead of 'he or she'?

'he or she' isn't inclusive. 
While an admittedly tiny portion of the population (approx 0.1%) is affected by this, you still shouldn't be rude.

Besides, 'he or she' is too many letters.
Singular 'they' is four letters, one syllable; 'he or she' is nine letters, three syllables.
'they' saves on character count and shortens spoken sentences.

Really, only reason 'he or she' should be used, instead of 'they', is for bloating word counts.
