# How do unerstand trans pplâ¸®

I'll open this document by saying that I'm no enlightened human, I'm a more-or-less average person.
The only thing that makes me qualified to write such a document is that I've got a bit more knowledge than the average Jo.

This document will be quite informal.

Go read my introduction first, then come back here.
I want you to realize that I am a person, just like you.
The introduction used to be here, for a better document flow.
I moved it for the sake of modularity.
Introduction over, so why was that so important?

**Trans *people*:**

	We're people just like you.
	No, seriously, read the last paragraph of my introduction;
	do I sound trans?
	We're quite human.

	Meaning: Stop saying 'trans(gender) people', start saying 'people'. 
	Unless being trans is important to the information you're trying to convey, don't mention it.
	
	More things you shouldn't say:

		+ '$name, who used to be $deadname, ...'; Just don't, their dead name is dead, you'll just encourage attacks.

		+ 'Back when $pronoun was $deadpronoun, ...'; Again, you'll encourage hate. Either tell past stories with current pronouns or use gender neutral pronouns.

		+ 'trap', 'tranny', 'Attack Helicopter', etc.; You do not have N-Word Privelages for those words and your Attack Helicopter(tm) jokes aren't funny. If you say those things, I *will* slap you.

	What should you say, then?:

		+ '$name'; that's their name. Not $deadname, their name is $name.

		+ Proper pronouns; do not misgender a person. If, when, you mess up, correct yourself immediately.

		+ 'they'; If you're ever unsure about gender, use gender neutral pronouns.

	This also means you should treat trans people as human;
	do not, unless asked to\*, use 'it' to refer to a trans person.
	We are people.

	Again, I need to hammer that home: transgender **people**
	
	\*^(Some NB people *do* use 'it' for their pronouns, in this case you should *absolutely* refer to it with 'it'.)

So, what else do you need to know?
You probably 'know' some things which are incorrect.
Let's fix that.

**Common Misconceptions**

	Genitals determine gender:

		Not true at all. 
		Gender is wholly independent of what genitals you have.
		A woman can have a penis, a man can have a vagina.

	Trans people just need to learn to love themselves:

		No;
		shuddup.
		We're, for lack of a better narrative, 'trapped in the wrong body'.

	It's just a kink thing:

		You're thinking of autogynephilia.
		The two are very different;
		autogynephilia is a fetish, being transgender is a discomfort with one's assigned gender.

	Sexuality = Gender:

		Trans people don't have to be straight.
		Trans people can be gay.
		Trans people can be asexual.
		
	Trans = Gay:

		Most trans people are straight;
		some aren't. 
		Our sexuality, and yours, is entirely separate from our gender.

Hopefully that's the basics cleared up.
Here's some more 'dont\'s':

**DON'Ts:**

	Worry about what's in our pants. It's none of your business.

	Misgender a person. Doing this is a dick move.

	Invalidate a person's gender. It is not your role to decide another human's gender.

	Try to 'turn them cis'. We cannot become cis any more than you can become trans.

	Discriminate. This sounds like a no-brainer, but some people still need to be reminded of it.

	Use slurs. It's just not okay to do.

	Gatekeep. 'Not trans enough' is a bunch of bullhockey, everybody's gender is their own.

	Let other people say transphobic stuff. Normalization of transphobia is a rampant issue in today's America.

	Treat trans people differently from cis people. 

**DOs:**
	
	Provide support. Everybody needs it from time to time.

	Call them by their name. It's their name, it matters.

	Use correct pronouns. Even if it takes a while to get used to, pronouns matter.

	Acknowledge their correct gender. It's valuable.

	Be receptive. If they tell you that you're doing something wrong, listen.

	Respect boundaries. Everybody has a limit to what they're willing to share, some things are too personal to talk about.
