I'm AMAB NB; 
this means I can't really speak for the AFAB side of the trans experience.
My name doesn't matter; 
I haven't chosen one yet. 
Just check whatever I've called myself on [GitHub](https://github.com/AbsolutelyLudicrous) to know what to call me.

I'm also super new to being trans; 
I only started questioning a month ago, with identifying as NB coming two weeks after that.
I didn't even plan on writing this document so soon, but I got forced out of the closet and now need to inform people.
I'll probably answer the question of "Aren\'t you rushing things a bit?" in a later section.

On a non trans-related end, I'm a huge Unix nerd, love everything physics-related, and am more-outdoorsy-than-average.
I'm currently typing this document from a modern [Solus](https://solus-project.com) box with space allocated for either [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), [GoboLinux](https://gobolinux.org/), [SourceMage](https://sourcemage.org/), or [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org/);
or maybe even my fourth [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) install.
I have a Network-Attached Storage box consisting of a Raspberry Pi 3 running [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) and way too many USB peripherals.
It isn't much, there are many like it, but this one is mine.
I administer this server from a decade-old [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org) box.
My love of physics is largely sci-fi related;
I take an interest in orbital mechanics, spaceflight, ISRU, on-orbit assembly, propulsion technology, etc.
I play way too much Kerbal Space Program, basically.
Finally, I'm decently outdoorsy.
I always *look* like I'm ready for a hike, but I think that's just the button-downs talking.
Doesn't mean I dislike nature, though;
some of my fondest memories are of hiking though exotic locales.
