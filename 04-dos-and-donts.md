**DON'Ts:**

+ Worry about what's in our pants. It's none of your business.

+ Misgender a person. Doing this is a dick move.

+ Invalidate a person's gender. It is not your role to decide another human's gender.
 
+ Try to 'turn them cis'. We cannot become cis any more than you can become trans.
 
+ Discriminate. This sounds like a no-brainer, but some people still need to be reminded of it.
 
+ Use slurs. It's just not okay to do.
 
+ Gatekeep. 'Not trans enough' is a bunch of bullhockey, everybody's gender is their own.
 
+ Let other people say transphobic stuff. Normalization of transphobia is a rampant issue in today's America.
 
+ Treat trans people differently from cis people. 

+ Ask somebody their 'birth gender', their 'birth name', or what genitals they've got. It's none of your business.

**DOs:**

+ Provide support. Everybody needs it from time to time.

+ Call them by their name. It's their name, it matters.

+ Use correct pronouns. Even if it takes a while to get used to, pronouns matter.

+ Acknowledge their correct gender. It's valuable.

+ Be receptive. If they tell you that you're doing something wrong, listen.

+ Respect boundaries. Everybody has a limit to what they're willing to share, some things are too personal to talk about.
