For some weird reason, humans have this aversion to being 'politically correct'.
The term 'politically correct' is often used to demean opponents for...

What exactly?

From birth, we humans are raised to be good people.
Hopefully, anyway.
Most people I know try, and usually succeed, to be a good person.
They help old ladies cross busy streets.
They point lost tourists in the right direction.
They donate to their local schools.

So why does this whole 'good person' thing go out the window once social issues are brought up?
