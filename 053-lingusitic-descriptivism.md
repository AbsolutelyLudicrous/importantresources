Language is a tool used to communicate ideas.
Anything which communicates an idea is language.

Let me tell you about my good friend [Linguistic Descriptivism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description)

Linguistic Descriptivism states that the only language, the only grammar rules, which matter are the ones which are *actually* used.
Anything which clearly communicates its idea is proper language.

There is no such thing as incorrect grammar, only communication failures.

This means that you, the population, can change your language.
