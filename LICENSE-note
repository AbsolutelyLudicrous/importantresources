The GNU AGPL may not be changed, as per the preamble.
This necessitates a 'rider', this document, to be added to the repo.

I cannot claim copyright over many of the links in this repo.
I do not have authority over the content of links in important-links
I can, however, apply the AGPL to the stuff here I've created.
It only applies to documents I have created.

To be honest, I'm not even sure if the AGPL can be used on non-software, but whatever.
