This series of documents aims to help people become more informed, and to serve as a collection of some of my thoughts.

Most documents are prepended with an index number. 
You should read the documents in this order.

As of 20171010, the index is a three-digit number.
The first two digits signify a 'chapter', a major document.
The last digit indicates an 'addendum', a supplementary document which fits the theme of the chapter but doesn't *quite* belong in the chapter.
