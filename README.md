# Resources for people.

This series of documents aims to help people become more informed, and to serve as a collection of some of my thoughts.

Most documents are prepended with an index number. 
You should read the documents in this order.

As of 20171010, the index is a three-digit number.
The first two digits signify a 'chapter', a major document.
The last digit indicates an 'addendum', a supplementary document which fits the theme of the chapter but doesn't *quite* belong in the chapter.

| **CHAPTERS:**
| ---
| 00X - Focus on preliminary information.
| ---
| 01X - Focus on the author.
| ---
| 02X - Focus on how trans people are *human*.
| ---
| 03X - Focus on common errors about trans people.
| ---
| 04X - Focus on being supportive and not being a dick.
| ---
| 05X - Focus on nonbinary identities, with a bit of linguistics thrown in.
