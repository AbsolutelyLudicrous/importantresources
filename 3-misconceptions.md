**Genitals determine gender:**

Not true at all. 
Gender is wholly independent of what genitals you have.
A woman can have a penis, a man can have a vagina.

**Trans people just need to learn to love themselves:**

No;
shuddup.
We're, for lack of a better narrative, 'trapped in the wrong body'.

**It's just a kink thing:**

You're thinking of autogynephilia.
The two are very different;
autogynephilia is a fetish, being transgender is a discomfort with one's assigned gender.

**Sexuality = Gender:**

Trans people don't have to be straight.
Trans people can be gay.
Trans people can be asexual.
	
**Trans = Gay:**

Most trans people are straight;
some aren't. 
Our sexuality, and yours, is entirely separate from our gender.
