**Genitals determine gender:**

Not true at all. 
Gender is wholly independent of what genitals you have.
A woman can have a penis, a man can have a vagina.

**Trans people just need to learn to love themselves:**

No;
shuddup.
We're, for lack of a better narrative, 'trapped in the wrong body'.

**It's just a kink thing:**

You're thinking of autogynephilia.
The two are very different;
autogynephilia is a fetish, being transgender is a discomfort with one's assigned gender.

**Sexuality = Gender:**

Trans people don't have to be straight.
Trans people can be gay.
Trans people can be asexual.
	
**Trans = Gay:**

Most trans people are straight;
some aren't. 
Our sexuality, and yours, is entirely separate from our gender.

**Everybody knows by the time they're four:**

Not really?
Maybe, I'm not a psychologist.
However, consider the amount of trans preschoolers to the amount of trans college students.
Consider that people can remain in denial for years.

Also consider the following:

At four, one is too young to know their gender.

At eight, one is just dealing with weird feelings, and will grow out of it once perberty hits.

At twelve, one is just experiencing wierd emotions from the start of puberty.

At sixteen. it's just the stress and hormones getting to you.

At twenty, you've lived your whole life as your assigned gender, so how would you know what gender you want to be?

At twenty-four, you've got bigger problems to deal with, like finding a job.

At twenty-eight and above, it's way too late to discover you're trans, most people know when they're four!

There is no perfect age of clarity when everything becomes clear and God(s) part the heavens to tell you that you're transgender.
Some people only accept themselves as trans well into their retirement.
Some people know befre they turn ten.
There really isn't a one-size-fits-all path of transness.
