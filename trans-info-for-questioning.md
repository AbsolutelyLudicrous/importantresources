This document aims to assist people who are questioning their gender.

[Read this,](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) it's a short essay which questions why being cis is considered the default.
[Then read this, see what matches up;](https://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) that article lists a few symptoms of dysphoria.

Then maybe read a few things in the [important-links file](https://github.com/AbsolutelyLudicrous/importantresources/blob/master/important-links).

Here's few things that I, personally, recommend:

+ Keep a journal. [This is what mine (censored) looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/ZbtJTGJ.jpg) If you can track your feelings, you'll be better able to reflect on your identity.

+ Do the 'button test'. If you could press a button and be something other than your current self, would you?

+ Ask yourself, are you okay with your body? If you could change it, would you?

+ Open up to the idea of being non-binary. Open up to the idea of being something other than strictly male or female. 

+ If you feel discomfort with your assigned gender, there's good odds that you're trans. Question even harderer.
