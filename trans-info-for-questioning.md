[Read this,](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) it's a short essay which questions why being cis is considered the default.
What you should get out of that essay is that ***it could happen to you!***
That was one of the things that got in the way of my acceptance, that being trans was something which happened to *other* people, I'm just a normal cishet boy who hates his body, right?

[Then read this, see what matches up;](https://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) 
that article lists a few symptoms of dysphoria.
While it shouldn't be taken as a conclusive test to determine whether or not you're trans, it is *really* helpful.
If you get a therapist, which you *absolutely should*, bring a few things up from it.

Then maybe read a few things in the [important-links file](https://github.com/AbsolutelyLudicrous/importantresources/blob/master/important-links).

Here's few things that I, personally, recommend:

+ Keep a journal. [This is what mine (censored) looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/ZbtJTGJ.jpg)^(Can you tell I was a bit angry?) If you can track your feelings, you'll be better able to reflect on your identity.

+ Do the 'button test'. If you could press a button and be something other than your current self, would you?

+ Ask yourself, are you okay with your body? If you could change it, would you?

+ Open up to the idea of being non-binary. Or any kind of genderqueer, really. You don't have to be strictly male or female.

+ If you feel discomfort with your assigned gender, there's good odds that you're trans. I would even call that the definition of transgender.

+ Talk to a gender therapist. They know more than we internet armchair psycholigists do.
