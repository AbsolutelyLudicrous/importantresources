I've heard a lot of jokes about '65 genders' or '70 genders', or however many defaults MyFaceGramChat has.
These jokes carry the undercurrent of a gender binary, the notion that there's only two genders.

That's wrong, there isn't a set number of genders.

Let's rebuild your concept of gender.

Your whole life, reader, you've probably thought of gender as two checkboxes, like so:

    Are you a boy or a girl?
    [boy]
    [girl]

That's not right.
Let's start by saying that gender is a spectrum.
It looks a bit like this:

    Are you a boy or a girl?
    [boy]----------------o----------------[girl]

While most people fall at the far ends of the spectrum, some people don't.
Nonbinary people fall roughly in the middle.
Demigender people are about half of the way to the edges.
Bigender and genderfluid people move around.

The spectrum model has a flaw, it treats man and woman as polar opposites.
This isn't entirely accurate, so let's improve the model.
Let's make the model a two-dimensional grid.

    Are you a boy or a girl?
    [boy]
    |b
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |
    |a                   g
    0---------------------[girl]

    Point 'b' is 100% male-identifying, point 'g' is 100% female-identifying, point 'a' is agender.

That's better.
Besides the explicitly marked points, the left edge could be trans-masc/demiboy; the bottom edge could be trans-femme/demigirl; and anywhere is the middle could be a nonbinary/genderqueer identity.
